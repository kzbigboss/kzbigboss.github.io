Now hanging out in Central Texas after recording just over 6k miles.  I was hit with a donut in Memphis and I loved it.  Good times.

## The numbers
Data pipelines continues to capture responses from my car.  So far there's just under 83k records for me to analyze/visualize.  This most recent leg of the trip was traveling about 850 miles from Atlanta, GA to West, TX.  Here is a glance at the latest GPS trail so far:

## Donuts
### Description (Hit and Run)
On this leg I drove through Memphis as I wanted to visit a donut shop recommended by a friend.  I did not realize what I was in store for.  The place was [Gibson Donuts](https://goo.gl/maps/U27KZsN8ec5xRkUU7) over in Memphis, TN.  I got there around 8a and was surprised to see a line out the door.  Turns out this place has been slinging donuts for 50+ years and has earned a reputation for high quality treats.

When I finally got inside, I had to order well before I could see the donut case.  I was a little disappointed about that but I decided to put my fate in the hands of the girl who took my order.  Before I could ask for her help, I told her this visit was my first time there... and before I could say anything more she got super excited and ran in to the kitchen.  When she came back she screamed, "fast hands!" and threw a fresh and hot glazed donut at me.  I had no idea what was happening and I caught the donut after it bounced off my chest.  I asked her what just happened and she explained they have a tradition of throwing donuts at new customers as part of the fun of the visit.  It was great!

I asked for her help: pick the six best donuts they make to assemble a half dozen for me to take on the road.  She went around asking the other workers there their thoughts and I ended up with: blueberry cake, pound cake, maple bacon raised, red velvet cake, chocolate frosted raised, and glazed raised.  I decided to wait and enjoy them with friends once I reached West, TX.  When we finally cut in to them, I thought all the donuts were great but was really blown away by the pound cake donut.  Would happily check out Gibson Donuts again!
