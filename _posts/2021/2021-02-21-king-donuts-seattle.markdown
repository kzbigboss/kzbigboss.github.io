There’s a place in Rainier Beach that’s equal parts laundry mat, teriyaki food, and donut bakery.  Best to just stop reading now if you think that’s weird.

Today’s 2021 Donut Tour update found me at King Donuts which is, no joke, the amalgamation of those three distinct businesses.  Even the street art is there to remind patrons, “it’s a real place”.

Nothing extravagant here so don’t expect seasonal berries or experimental spices.  Instead, these guys know how to nail the basics with a solid variety of cake and raised donuts.  The way that King fries their donuts results in a hard and crispy exterior with a deliciously crumbly interior.  Today I goofed and got three similar donuts: two old-fashioned (one glazed, one chocolate) and one glazed buttermilk bar.  Looking back I should have added a raised donut to the mix.

The taste of these donuts were great.  With that hard exterior, my favorite way to eat these donuts is by dunking them into coffee.  The coffee flavor is absorbed by the soft interior while it slightly softens, but doesn’t break, the crispy outside.  This was my first time trying their buttermilk bar.  It was a lovely balance of buttery and acidity flavors to enjoy on a chilly Sunday morning.

It’s hard to figure out where King is on my list.  Truth is their donuts are a genre all their own so it’s not fair trying to compare.  I’m not sure when I’ll head there next but, when I do, I won’t be disappointed.
