Did someone say donuts? It’s no shocker that I think of donuts continuously; however, I don’t eat them as frequently anymore. This year I’m going to try and enjoy them once a month - so here’s the 2021 Donut Tour update for January!

These blessed filled goodies are from General Porpoise: picked up a couple off their standard menu (vanilla cream, lemon custard) and a couple of their seasonal offerings (salted caramel, blood orange + cranberry). Met up with a friend and enjoyed them with some coffee at Cal Anderson Park. The last time I was here was during the CHOP days.
These style donuts are always a mess to eat - especially in these limited napkin days of COVID.  Still, the exterior light dusting of sugar coupled with the deep fried shell balance well against the interior doughy goodness and filling. They’re the perfect size: not as big as a standard filled donut but a size up from a mini.
General Porpoise are my favorite donuts so it’s fitting they were the first stop on this year’s donut tour. While it won’t come soon enough, I look forward to getting back in their cafes in the mornings to enjoy a coffee+donut, people watch, and write a journal entry.
