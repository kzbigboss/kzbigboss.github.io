Today’s stop on my 2021 donut tour is Half and Half (HnH) Doughnut Company in the heart of Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Only one word properly describes their work: artisan.  Donuts here are made with love - the kind of love that results in two donuts never looking the same.  Here you choose from a collection of old fashioned, filled raised, and cronut style donuts.  HnH produces the most uniquely flavored old fashioned donuts I have had.  Tasting them is always a great experience… even if it costs me some embarrassment stuck at the case debating what to get.

I grabbed a bunch of old fashioned donuts: “black and white” with chocolate base and vanilla frosting + chocolate swirls, “Guinness” with chocolate base topped with, you guessed it, Guinness frosting, and finally a “Pike Place Market Spice” with a black tea base along with a spiced orange frosting.  I also grabbed a “Marocchino Bismark” filled raised donut.  The best part about this collection?  This was my first time trying each of these flavors.

I grabbed an outdoor table with my donut buddy and cut up the old fashioned donuts to try a bit of each of them.  HnH’s donuts look substantial and that tricks your mind when you pick one up and realize how deceptively light they are.  Brittle frosting and a crispy exterior hide a crumbly yet dense cake donut.  Eating them consist of a satisfying crunch followed by a punch of flavor.  I avoided cutting in to the filled donut for fear of it falling apart on the way home.  Wrong.  When I cut in to it later in the day, the whipped filling stood firm and tall.  This donut was wonderful: a chewy but not crispy exterior contained a filling that balanced the espresso’s bitterness against the caramel’s sweetness.

The only hiccup today was the weather.  Seattle’s usual mist was replaced with legit rain drops that made today’s experience a little more wet and cold than I would have liked.
