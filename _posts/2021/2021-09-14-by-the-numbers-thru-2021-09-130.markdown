Running out of miles (and donuts) between road trip and home!  Currently hanging out in an awesome coffee bar in Salem, Oregon.  As fate would have it, a close friend is out here for work.  I timed my road trip so we could check out Salem together.

## Donuts
### Description
Had to take a break on donuts the last few stops.  I wish I could tell you it was because I wanted to be healthy.  Truth is my stomach was wrecked after days of hotel food and donuts.  BUT NOW I'M BACK IT, BABY - WOOO.

Today's donut tour was early this morning in downtown Salem.  The place was [Bearscat Bakehouse](https://goo.gl/maps/Hajo6yxPhkUH3han9).  What's a "bearscat" you ask?  No idea.  Apparently it is a "cowboy" term for donut.  I have not heard this term before and have been donut hunting in Texas... but I digress.  We grabbed coffee nearby at [The Governor's Cup Coffee Roasters](https://g.page/thegovcup?share); the staff was fun and the coffee was solid.

What makes Bearscat Bakehouse distinct is that they have fun with one of their old fashioned donuts.  Rather than prepare it in a ring shape, they make their chocolate glazed available in a semi-boomerang shape.  Chocolate glazed old fashioned is my all time favorite style of donut so I was excited to try it.
