I am Mark Kazzaz.  I graduated college with a masters in accounting.  I became a Certified Public Accountant and then drove my career towards the intersection of Business and Technology.

After years of finance, accounting, and business intelligence work, I took a leap and joined big tech in 2014.  Since then my achievements revolve around deploying data infrastructure, building data products, and driving data strategies.  On the personal side, my hobbies include taking road trips and trying new donuts.

I live in downtown Seattle after spending time in Chicago and Atlanta.

## Whatâ€™s this?

I write quite a bit. I have been using [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) since October 2012 as a personal journal.  But when it comes to online journaling or blogging, I felt like I was always had to compromise on features amongst all available solutions.  I have been meaning to start a blog on a few different topics: technology, road trips, donuts, coffee, etc... I use WordPress for my [Tesla Roadtrips](https://kzroadtrip.wordpress.com).  I juggled between WordPress and Medium for my other topics but never made a decision.

I really enjoy typing in markdown so it hit me: why not use markdown as the basis for blogging.  I can push the markdown to a repo, let [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a static blog engine) do its magic, and have [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (a web page solution) serve the content.  It brings me back to being a kid and writing HTML... except that it is a whole lot easier now with tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (file change management) and [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) (templating and automation).

I still plan to host data analysis write ups in the repo that stores the related code.  This avenue, instead, will be used when my primary medium are words.

Enjoy.
